# Big Ben
 A very useful discord bot. That will let you know if an hour has passed by joining your voice channel and playing bell sounds from the Big Ben.
 You can even change the sound to whatever you want. This bot isn't made to be useful, just to be a fun bot to have and prank some members of your server.

## Suggestions, bugs, feature requests

Want to contribute? Great, we love that! Please take your time on [opening a new issue](https://github.com/SiebeBaree/Big-Ben/issues/new).

## How to use the bot?

Invite the bot into your server(s) and give the bot enough perms to join and talk in voice channels. If you want to change the sound use `$sound` and upload a `.mp3` file in the same command.

Use `$help` in your server to view the full list of commands.
